# Collection Nexus

## What will the application do?

**Collection Nexus** enables users to organize their cards by creating categories based on type, theme, or game. The app allows users to track details about each card, such as its condition, rarity, edition, and origin. It also provides a feature for maintaining a wishlist of cards users hope to acquire.

## Who will use it?

- **Hobby card collectors**: Individuals who want to track their collections, including trading cards, sports cards, or collectible card games.
- **Investors**: People who view cards as assets and require a tool for tracking valuations.
- **Players of collectible card games**: Gamers who need to organize playable decks and keep track of tournament-ready cards.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

As a passionate collector of basketball cards and Magic: The Gathering cards, I am personally invested in this hobby. While I have used existing card-tracking apps, I’ve noticed significant shortcomings in their user interface design. This project excites me because it gives me the opportunity to create a card organizing app tailored to my vision, improving the user experience and addressing the gaps in current offerings.
